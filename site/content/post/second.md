# The Pitch

## Lab Rat

Become Tesla, a rat stuck in a cage in Widdershins Labs--a scientific facility researching the
worldâ€™s most extraordinary phenomena. One day, an experiment goes awry, mutating Tesla into a
bizarre half-human, half-rat creature. Tesla seizes the chance to escape the cage, but Widdershins
is a big place.

## Running in the maze

The game play is the escape of the lab. The player interacts with other characters to learn more
about the story. While events unfold, the player learns more elements to solve puzzles to unlock
more parts of the level/story. The story will feature the episodic storyline of the following:
Escape the lab, The Sickening Sewers, The Dark Wood and Return to the Lab.

##Friend or Foe
The objective is to escape to freedom, Tesla will need to make friends with other fugitives,
master the strange logic of chemical interactions that governs the lab, and somehow discover the
secret to complete the transformation into a human!

## Getting the Cheese

On a broader scale this game aims to encourage learning. The chemistry aspect of the game
allows players learn from interacting. Will the player be able to solve the science through
experimentation to get to freedom, or will they fail and be stuck in the lab forever.

## Elementize

The core puzzle-solving mechanic in this point-and-click adventure requires
the player to use the elementizer, using elements from the periodic table to
manipulate the environment. The player gains access to new elements as
they progress, increasing the number of potential solutions.

## Cartoonistic

The art will be 2d, with a retro cartoon style. The style is chosen to appeal to
the main target audience of children.
