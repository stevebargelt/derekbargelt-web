## Hi, I'm Derek

I have always enjoyed writing and storytelling, and my career goal is to be part of something bigger and to make a story that touches people. I recently completed a certificate in game design through the University of Washington and am eager to apply the experiences I had and skills I learned to a career in the game industry.
